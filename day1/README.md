CYBERSECURITY -> Practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks. -> Protecting data -> Monitor Networks -> Implement Security Measures -> Stay Updated

DIVISIONS IN CYBERSECURITY:

Red Team -> Ethical hacking
-> Offensive Security

Purple -> Imporvements in detection and defence Team -> Cyber Security Managers

Blue -> Damage Control Team ->Threat Hunters

TYPES OF HACKERS :-

White Hat Hackers -> Also called ethical hackers. -> They work legally to find and fix security flaws in systems. -> Often hired by companies for penetration testing or security audits.

Black Hat Hackers -> These are criminal hackers. -> They break into systems to steal data, spread malware, or cause harm. -> Their actions are illegal and harmful.

Grey Hat Hackers -> A mix of white and black hat. -> They hack without permission, but not for personal gain. -> Often report the flaws they find but still break the law.

Script Kiddies -> Amateur hackers who use ready-made tools/scripts. -> They lack real hacking skills and usually hack just to impress or cause mischief.

Hacktivists -> Hackers with a political or social motive. -> They attack websites or systems to promote their cause (e.g., leak documents, deface websites).

State-Sponsored -> Hackers who work for a government. Hackers -> Their goal is often cyber-espionage, stealing information, or sabotaging other nations' systems.

Cyber Terrorists -> Hackers who use technology to create fear or disrupt society. -> Their motive can be political, religious, or ideological. -> Target critical systems like banks, hospitals, or power grids.

TYPES OF CYBERSECURITY THREATS :-

PHISHING Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers trick people into giving personal information like passwords or bank details by pretending to be a trusted source, usually through fake emails, messages, or websites.

RANSOMWARE Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that locks or encrypts a victim's files or system, and then demands money (a ransom) to restore access.

MALWARE Malware (short for malicious software) is a type of software created to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or data. It includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal personal information, slow down systems, or completely block access to files.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING Social engineering is a method used by attackers to trick people into giving up confidential information like passwords, OTPs, or personal data. Instead of hacking systems, they manipulate human emotions like trust, fear, or urgency to gain access. It's basically hacking people instead of computers.

ZERO-DAY ATTACK A Zero-Day Attack is a cyber attack that happens by exploiting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the software maker.Since the developers have zero days to fix the flaw before it’s exploited, it's called a zero-day.These attacks are dangerous because there's no patch or defense available yet when the attack happens.

MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE-ATTACK Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack is a cyber attack where a hacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without them knowing.For example, in a public Wi-Fi network, an attacker can sit between you and a website, stealing login info, credit card numbers, or messages. It’s like someone secretly listening and interfering in a private conversation.
